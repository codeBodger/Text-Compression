# Text-Compression
A python program to edit text and save it as a compressed file.  

You may need to install colorama and/or Tkinter

I used slitely modified code from https://www.codespeedy.com/create-a-text-editor-in-python/

This has only been tested on Windows 10, so it  might not work elsewhere

To run the program, simply run main.py.
